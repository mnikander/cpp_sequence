# cpp_structured_templates

Can structured programs be generated at compile-time using templates?

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt get install g++ cmake libgtest-dev
```

2. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone #...
cd #... navigate into the freshly cloned repo
```

3. Build and run:
```bash
mkdir out && cd out && cmake .. && cd .. # out-of-source build
cmake --build out/ && ./out/unit_tests
```
